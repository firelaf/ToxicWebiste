                Toxic was established in the summer of 2016 by our founder Svet.
                Him, along with Kris, Vasko, Niki, Miro, Ivo, and Kiro teamed up
                to try out for a spot at the asian pop culture event 'Aniventure
                2016's k-pop dance cover panel panel. The 7 started off as just
                a bunch of buddies looking for a hobby and they could have never
                known what the future held. We were the first all male k-pop
                cover dance group in Bulgaria and we remain the only one to this
                day.

                Our debut performance was less than spectacular to say the
                least. But we held on and kept on going until eventually
                something started clicking. We developed synergy and
                synchronicity over our next few performances. With our new
                member Dan, we headed back to the stage for a charity concert a
                few months after our debut, and we felt driven to make something
                from this.

                The culmination of our efforts in our first year together was us
                finally competiting on stage. We went up against the best k-pop
                dancers in Bulgaria at the 'K-Pop World Festival: Sofia'. We
                wanted to prove to ourselves and the rest of the community that
                the all-male group is not just a gimmick and we showed them our
                best with our performance of 'Infinite - The Eye'. We took home
                third place, a result with which we were extremely happy with.
                It served only to increase our drive for performance and
                competition in the future.

                As our vigor and drive crept up, so did our desire to do
                something big. What better way to impress than return to the
                stage it all started on? Armed with our new member Kircho, we
                headed out for our most ambitious performance yet, on the
                biggest stage. It was time for 'Aniventure 2017', and our 9-man
                performance of 'SF9 - K.O.'.

                Fast forward to the next year. We return as five members to
                'K-Pop World Festival: Sofia' in 2018 armed with two years of
                experience, three months of practice, and determination to win.
                A third place finish wouldn't satisfy us anymore. We aimed to
                win it all. With our most intense choreography yet, 'A.C.E -
                Callin', we convincingly snatched the gold medal, and the
                feeling was indescribable. The biggest competition in our field
                was finally ours.<br />
                As winners of the regional round of 'K-Pop World Festival', we
                entered the internal competition. 12 teams from around the world
                were selected to head out all the way to Changwon, South Korea,
                train for two weeks, and compete in the Festival's finals. All
                broadcasted on Korea's national TV, KBS. And we did it once
                again, being the first Bulgarian group to ever compete in the
                finals of the festival.

                Since our adventure to Korea, we've been hard at work developing
                ourselves and our craft, and having as much fun as we can doing
                it. Pandemic times have hit us hard, but with our new addition,
                Kai, we can't wait to go back on stage. Our story is far from
                over, and we hope you stay along, and enjoy it with us.
